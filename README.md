DESCRIPTION:This is a Java-based multi-user chat application using sockets and multithreading. The **ChatServer** listens for client connections, manages them, and broadcasts messages. The **ChatClient** connects to the server, enabling real-time messaging between users. Run the server first, then multiple clients to test the chat functionality.
